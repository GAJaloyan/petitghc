No global declaration can have the name of one of the functions from the librarie.
Problem with user-defined labels when similar to the ones from the assembler
(spim complains).

spim does not understand the syscall 17 which specifies the exit code, but it
works in Mars. That's why at the end of program containing errors, there will 
be an exec-fail message from spim .
